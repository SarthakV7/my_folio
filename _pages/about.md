I am a freelance Data Scientist also working part time at [Applied Roots](https://www.appliedroots.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

At [Applied Roots](https://www.appliedroots.com/){:target="\_blank"}, one of the major tasks is evaluating, debugging our student's assignments, and giving them the right feedback.
I am a part of the team where we evaluate 400 assignments on an average daily, and resolve our students machine learning concept related queries.
Apart from the evaluation and queries resolution, we are also responsible for updating the assignments to keep them in pace with the
AI/Data Science industry.

Before starting my career in Data Science, I was a Xamarin iOS developer at [Redallcco infotech](https://www.redaallco.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
At this point of time, I realized the enormous possibilities of humans and computers working together on data, developing techniques that could benefit businesses and researches across various fields.

This was exciting enough to get me started with wrapping my head around data science and dive deeper into the specifics of what makes these algorithms so powerful that in some domains, they are even capable of outperforming humans.
I started investing more and more of my free time in utilizing resources like online courses and certifications, participating in data challenges and sharing my skills by writing blogs and developing projects on applications of data science in multiple domains.

2 years ago, I gave up my role as Xamarin developer at [Redallcco infotech](https://www.redaallco.com/){:target="\_blank"} and started investing all of my time in developing new data skills. As of now, I am working on a research project in the domain of applications of machine learning in bioinformatics, working part time at Applied Roots and freelancing as a Data Scientist to help businesses solve modern problems using modern data driven approaches.
